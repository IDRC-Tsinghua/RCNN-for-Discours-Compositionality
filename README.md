# RCNN-for-Discours-Compositionality
Trying to implement a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks for Discourse Compositionality described in http://nal.co/papers/KalchbrennerBlunsom_CVSC13

## Dependencies
numpy
theano
word2vec
python-dateutil
nltk

## SWDA
It's able to get the swda dataset from http://compprag.christopherpotts.net/swda.html
Notice that swap.py is modified a little in this project to make sure it runs correctly.
